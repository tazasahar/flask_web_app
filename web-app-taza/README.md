# Health and Safety Portal

### Description

The purpose of my app is to provide health and safety professionals a portal to record and manage all of their health and safety incidents. This job is usually done on paper, but with my app it can be easily done via the web and H&S managers will no longer have to worry about losing their paper work, which is a legal requirement. There is a login and registration system. Once the H&S professional is logged in they can complete all of the CRUD operations.
